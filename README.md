# CS419-Project
The project aims to prepare a model and find optimal trading strategy using the data extracted
from Bitmex. The projects consists of two stages. The first stage has three parts:
 1. Extracting data from the Bitmex trading platform
 2. Using candlestick diagrams to predict market sentiment. Also, enhance this result using the
    XGBoost algorithm. This is a classification problem
 3. Predict the closing price of securities using an RNN and updating the weight matrix for
    historical data of different times
The second stage consists of:
 1. Building an Recurrent Neural Network on the Bitmex data to predict the closing prices of
    securities for a given time interval. For this the LSTM library could be implemented.
